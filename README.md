- The Hive: Bee origin point, from where bees exit to invade the colony.
- Tunnels: Linking together the colony and the hive, allowing the deployment of ants and hosting multiple bees.
- Ants: Deployable troops with various abilities, requiring food for placement. Types include HarvesterAnt (adds food to colony) and ThrowerAnt (attacks bees).
