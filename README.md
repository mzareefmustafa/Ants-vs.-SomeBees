A robust Python-based system that interprets a specific subset of the Scheme language.

# Key features:

Parsing: User input is parsed into the interpreter's internal Python representation of Scheme expressions.

Evaluation: Scheme expressions are evaluated to obtain values, following rules for call expressions and special forms.

Application: Built-in procedures are applied using the apply method, while user-defined procedures create a new call frame and recursively evaluate their body.

Printing: The obtained value is printed as a string representation.

Looping: The interpreter operates within a Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL), handling user interactions.
